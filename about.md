| Functional Consultant |Jan, 2019 | Sep, 2019 | Madrid |

#### Description

I worked as a Functional Consultant for a variety of customers, such *[Macsa](https://www.macsa.com/), [Merkal](https://www.merkal.com/), [Mercedes Benz](https://www.mercedes-benz.es/), [Profim](https://www.arquia.com/es-es/profim/)*, among others, answering the users doubts about their business flow and with the CRM software, the majority online versions.

However, my main objective was to support and maintain [Openbank](https://www.openbank.es/)'s Unified Service Desk for six months visiting their main CTI offices. While fixing problems, I could work with Action Calls, Windows Navigation Rules, configuration fields and Hosted Controls.

I also had the chance to develop some console programs to connect the CRM and add, modify and even delete some data rows and fixing or evolving some C# plugins according to the new user's functionality requested.

Other tasks done were creating or modifying web resources with HTML and Javascript, using many [XrmToolBox](https://www.xrmtoolbox.com/) plugins and Microsoft Dynamics official tools.

#### Description

I spent the hours of University practice at Televida, where I took part in the IT Department. My main objective was to generate a Microsoft Access Database in order to keep control all over the technology items such laptops and computers, screens, conference's phones and even wires.
On that database, I had to add new functionalities according to the IT needs, like forms to enable users to register their records or look up specified items.

Also, I could see how firewalls and servers work, but other tasks that I had full responsabilities were format and install PC's for the office team, fix some connectivity problems along the office and even document all the procedures of the company for users and IT workers.
